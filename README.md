# odin-recipes-new

This is my second attempt at the Odin Projects curriculum. I have spent some time learning Javascript, Html, and Css. Now I hope to go through the program, do the foundations course, the javascript track, the ruby track and then get a career in webdev. 

For the first project, I will review and use HTML basics and create a simple recipes page.
